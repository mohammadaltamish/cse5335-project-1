# cse5335-project-2
#### a. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
- I found usage of jquery and nodejs to be easy, reusing them in project 2 made my understanding of them a bit more thorough.

#### b. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
- Figuring out new technology like mongodb, how to use it with nodejs, how to use it on heroku was a bit challenging.

#### c. If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
- My biggest concern would be the fear of unknown as in not knowing how deep do these technologies go and figuring out the nooks and crannies of these technologies.
